		<p>
			People have been following the Buddha's road to freedom for almost 2,500 years. The life tale of the Buddha has inspired and motivated countless others for an equally long time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Buddha's life narrative is a tribute to his almost superhuman efforts, his seemingly endless patience, and his profound love and compassion, which inspired him to teach others about this way.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can follow the path of the Buddha, as long as we are willing to make the necessary effort. As the Buddha said:<br> “You yourselves must strive, the Buddhas only point the way”
